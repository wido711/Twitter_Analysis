# Twitter_Analysis
Analysis of tweets

This project was done as part of a master's program performing a text analysis on sample data.

Rather than perform the analysis on data that was already at Kaggle, I developed using python Tweepy library a pull of data directly from Twitter.  I then used this new dataset to perform an analysis using an LDA model to derive topics and used this dataset to formulate a word cloud.

This could be leveraged in multiple ways, but more importantly given a set of data (say transcripts from phone calls) you can perform a topic analysis to pull new and interesting topics from the transcripts.  Then develop a chatbot that addresses these newly identified topics.
